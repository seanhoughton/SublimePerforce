This is a plugin for Sublime Text 2 which automatically opens files for edit in Perforce.

==Installation:==

===Option 1:===

If you don't plan on getting updates or making improvements you can simply copy "perforce.py" into your user packages folder...

<code>cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User</code>
<code>wget https://github.com/seanhoughton/SublimePerforce/blob/master/perforce.py</code>

===Option 2:===

If you would like to use git to keep up-to-date and to make improvements you can init a repository in your plugins folder.  Unfortunately Sublime Text doesn't support subfolders so you can only have a single repository in here.

<code>cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User</code>
<code>git init</code>
<code>git remote add origin git://github.com/seanhoughton/SublimePerforce.git</code>
<code>git pull origin</code>
