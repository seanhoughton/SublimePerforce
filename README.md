This is a plugin for Sublime Text 2 which automatically opens files for edit in Perforce.

##Installation:

###Option 1:

If you don't plan on getting updates or making improvements you can simply copy "perforce.py" into your user packages folder...

    mkdir C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\SublimePerforce
    cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\SublimePerforce
    wget https://github.com/seanhoughton/SublimePerforce/blob/master/perforce.py
